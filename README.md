Hi there 👋

My name is Aldo Darel. I am a Software Engineer 💻 especially in the Web Development field 🌐. 

 🔭 I’m currently studying at Del Institute of Technology in North Sumatera taking Applied Bachelor of Software Engineering Technology from 2022-2026 🔥🔥

 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop web-based or mobile applications so that I can eventually build a business or startup in the IT field in Indonesia. 👨🏼‍💻🚀🚀

 👯 I’m looking to collaborate and learn many more things with expert software developers so that I can also gain more knowledge because there are quite a lot of new technologies emerging in this field

 🤔 I’m looking for help with Google or OpenAI as my colleagues in overcoming difficulties such as understanding code🤔, troubleshooting errors😵‍💫, finding bugs🤯, and other tasks typical of a true developer ❤️‍🔥😎

 💬 Contact me on my social media to ask anything:
